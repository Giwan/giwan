# Info
I can't update the readme on this project. It's being used by GitHub for my profile. 
This is therefore just a small update on what is going with this project. 

## Security
GitHub is saying that I need to update a package but there is no node_modules in this repository. 
I checked if there is another branch but there is none of that either. 
I'm not sure where the security alert is coming from but I guess I can ignore it.
